    <p>I spent 3 weeks in London this past summer, and I saw so much
        culture and history... so many gorgeous things that I wanted to 
    hold onto forever. The historic architecture contrasts breathtakingly
with the modern bohemoth skyscrapers in a dramatic and stunning way. </p>

I probably walked about 20 miles a day, looking up and around at everything.
The rose gardens are magic, the sculptural qualities of all of the architecture... 
If I had been using a film camera I would have gone completely broke. Everything about the 
parks and green spaces felt so clean and natural. Here are some shots I took. But there
are hundreds more...

            <p>I wandered for hours and miles, taking pictures of everything. So many pictures, it almost overwhelmed my computer.
                I feel like I truly gained more skill with my digital photography, simply because I had so much amazing subject matter to work with.
